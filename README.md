## Bugs


## Version Control

- GitHub

- Gitpod

Gitpod served as the local repository and IDE. GitHUb served as the remote repository.

The following steps were followed to maintain version control

- I created a repository on GitHub and named it 'knowledge quiz'

- I then signed in to Gitpod and opened a new workspace via the repository name 'knowledge quiz'

- I created the pages, folders and files on GitPod

- I saved my work on GitPod at regular intervals and pushed it to GitHub to keep it safe
This is the process I followed having completing each significant section of code, I typed the following into the terminal:

- git add . (This added the work to git)

- git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE" (This committed the work)

- git push (This pushed the work to GitHub)

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab

- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
